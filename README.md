Project Description
This project is a Java-based tool for encrypting and decrypting text using an algorithm I have made up. It is designed to demonstrate basic principles of cryptography and can be used for securely encoding and decoding messages.

Features
• Encryption: Convert plain text into encoded text using a chosen algorithm.
• Decryption: Decode the encrypted text back to its original plain text form.
• User-Friendly Interface: A simple command-line or Swing graphical interface that makes the tool easy to use.

How to Use
1. Encryption Mode:
2. Input the text you want to encrypt.
3. Press the 'Enter' key
4. The tool will then output the encrypted text.

Decryption Mode:

1. Input the encrypted text.
2. Press the 'Enter' key
3. The tool will output the original plain text.
